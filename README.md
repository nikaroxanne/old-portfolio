1. Bio.html, index.html and resume.html all implemented correctly. There are no apparent issues.

2. I asked my friend Brian some questions about HTML and CSS and he was very helpful at explaining the differences in implementation and how they are different from other programming languages.

3. I spent approximately 20 hours on this assignment.
