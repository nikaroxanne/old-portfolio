        <h2> Blurring the lines between code and art </h2>
        <p> As a dual degree student at Tufts University and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (SMFA), my work is intrinsically informed by a cross-section of disciplines. I am pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from Tufts, as well as a Bachelor of Fine Arts, with a concentration in painting and drawing, from the SFMA. I aim to use code as a new medium to create work in a deconstructive and reconstructive process that examines the root body of an "image."</p>
        <p> This conceptualization of imagery has propagated in my work this term, as I have been researching more abstract motifs form the world of technology, most tably the representation of the female form on social media platforms. This representation also manigests in news and advertising pieces that are presented and distributed throughout the internet via social media. </p>
        <p> Drawing from these pieces of research and information, my current work tries to deconstruct images of the female body that have already been reconstructed via code and software. This process of disfiguring and restructuring is a process of trying to respond to a statement I have been ruminating on since returning from my year abroad in Paris: From Simone de Beauvoir's <span class= "title"> Le Deuxieme Sexe </span> : On ne nait pas femme: on le devient" (One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman). </p>
