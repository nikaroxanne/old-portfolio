            <h4> Tufts University </h4>
            <h4> Spring 2015 semester </h4>
            <p> The annual "Art in April" show is an exhibition that takes place in Dowling Hall at Tufts University every spring from April to May to celebrate the work of artist in the university's dual degree program. Dual degree students apply to curate or co-curate the show through an application process and my friend Catherine Armistead and I were chosen to curate the show based on the strength of our application and our innovative theme for the show: "Works in Progress." The theme of the show was to highlight works that questioned the notion of finished artwork and we urged students to break away from traditional framing, presentation or even rules of completion. Catherine and I selected the artworks to be displayed from the vast pool of applications and then created labels for each artwork. As co-curators, we organized and hung the final exhibition. In the weeks leading up to the opening reception, we advertised on social media, and also with flyers and thrrough connecting with peers and faculty. We also designed and printed 100 gallery gallery for the opening reception, which listed all of the artists in the show and the important information for the "Works in Progress" exhibition.</p>
